## mpv scripts
This repository contains Lua scripts for [mpv player](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv "GitHub project") 

These are small and usefull improvements for mpv for iPTV live stream watching:
* [Show Stream Title](scripts/show-stream-title.lua) - shows OSD channel title when switching the channels
* [OSD Clock](scripts/osd-clock.lua) - shows periodically OSD clock
* [TV out](scripts/tv.lua) - TV out activation/deactivation on mpv playback

#### To Do
Possible future improvements and ideas (in arbitrary order):
* handle stream errors
* show channel logo
* somehow handle changing streams in user friendly manner
* streams playlist autoupdate

#### History
 version 2017.4 - the initial GitHub release in April 2017
